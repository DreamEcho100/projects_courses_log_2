// motion = function{forces}
// Note: Motion is effect. Force is cause. The motion of an object is the result of the forces acting on it.
// The mathematical relationship between force and motion is known as the “Law of Motion.”
// To be able to put the principle stated in this note to use, you need to know the following:
// • Definitions. The precise definitions of motion and force.
// • The law of motion. In other words, the precise mathematical form of the function that relates
// a force to the motion it produces.
// • Force laws. In other words, how to calculate the forces. There are equations that tell you how
// to calculate each type of force.

// The difference between animation and simulation
// When you simulate something, you don’t just depict how it behaves under one set of conditions;
// you allow for many, even infinitely many, conditions. Building interactive simulations including physics makes
// things behave as they do in the real world: interacting with the environment and with the user to produce diverse and
// complex outcomes.
// There is more. If you really pay attention to accuracy, you can even build a simulation that is so realistic it can be
// used as a virtual lab. You’ll be able to experiment with it to learn how things actually work out there in the real world.
// Animation attempts to reproduce the motion of an object directly. Simulation programs the laws of motion and then
// derives the motion of the object. It is much easier to code up the cause of motion than its effect. Moreover, an animation
// generally depicts a single scenario. But a simulation can potentially handle an infinite number of different scenarios.

// Note  Simple laws of motion and simple force laws can give rise to complex motions. It is therefore generally easier
// to code the laws rather than the motions. Hence, paradoxically, simulation can be easier than animation.

// The four steps for programming physics
// Physics => Equations => Algorithms => Code

// The physics of a bouncing ball
// The first clue to understanding why the
// volleyball moves the way it does is to find out what forces are acting on it.

// Programming physics involves four steps:
//   - Identifying what physics principles you need.
//   - Writing down the relevant equations.
//   - Devising a numerical algorithm for solving the equations.
//   - Writing the code.
// So it involves knowledge and skills in four different areas:
//   - Physics.
//   - Math.
//   - Numerical methods.
//   - Programming.
